# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Text-Messages
This project is about the Sentiment Analysis of the text messages. Sentiment analysis of text messages is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed. Here, TextBlob library is used to determine the emotional tone of the messages in the dataset. It involves analyzing the text to identify and categorize the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. For preprocessing the data and cleaning the text, Neattext is used. This project also focusses on developing an Machine Learning model to predict the text messages using LogisticRegressor and the corresponding confusion matrix is also obtained for the Machine Learning model.
